SIMPLEMNRM: in src/core/population.h

	Selects between optimized and basic mNRM version, but this is
	now set from the CMakeFile.txt, should not be set manually
	anymore.

SIMPACTEVENT_MAXPERSONS: src/core/simpactevent.h

	The maximum number of Persons that can be stored in an event
	on creation. 

DISABLE_PARALLEL: src/core/parallel.h

	This disables the use of the '#pragma omp' stuff, so that when
	the parallel version is executed you actually get a single core
	version. But in this version, the extra overhead code (mutexes
	etc) is still executed, so this may be useful for benchmarking.

PERSONALEVENTLIST_EXTRA_DEBUGGING: src/core/personaleventlist.h
	
	If enabled, extra checks will be performed in the optimized
	version to see if the earliest event is tracked correctly

STATE_SHOW_EVENTS: src/mnrm/state.h:
	
	Will cause the events in the system to be listed each time
	an event fires. Very useful to check at which point exactly
	basic and optimized version start diverging.

EVENTBASE_CHECK_INVERSE: src/mnrm/eventbase.h

	If enabled, extra checks will be performed to make sure that the
	calculateInternalTimeInterval and solveForRealTimeInterval functions
	are balanced. Should not be set manually, is now set using the NDEBUG
	define automatically in the release versions.

RELATIONSHIPLIST_CHECK_CONSISTENCY: src/person.h

	Currently, a person has both a vector and a set containing the 
	relationships he/she is in. This define performs an additional check
	on the consistency of these two representations

EVENTBASE_ALWAYS_CHECK_NANTIME: used in src/mnrm/eventbase.h

	If set, after calculation timing info, a check is always done to see
	if the time has not become a NaN value.

POPULATION_ALWAYS_RECALCULATE: used in src/lib/core/population.cpp

	If set, all event times will always be recalculated, similar to the
	basic mNRM version.
