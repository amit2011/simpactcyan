POPULATIONEVENT_MAXPERSONS: src/lib/core/populationevent.h

	The maximum number of persons that can be stored in an event
	on creation. 

DISABLE_PARALLEL: src/lib/core/parallel.h

	This disables the use of the '#pragma omp' stuff, so that when
	the parallel version is executed you actually get a single core
	version. But in this version, the extra overhead code (mutexes
	etc) is still executed, so this may be useful for benchmarking.

PERSONALEVENTLIST_EXTRA_DEBUGGING: src/lib/core/personaleventlist.h
	
	If enabled, extra checks will be performed in the optimized
	version to see if the earliest event is tracked correctly

ALGORITHM_SHOW_EVENTS: src/lib/mnrm/algorithm.h:
	
	Will cause the events in the system to be listed each time
	an event fires. Very useful to check at which point exactly
	basic and optimized version start diverging.

ALGORITHM_DEBUG_TIMER: src/lib/mnrm/algorithm.h:

	Enable timing info about certain functions. Can be helpful while
	profiling, to compare to another version.

EVENTBASE_ALWAYS_CHECK_NANTIME: used in src/lib/mnrm/eventbase.h

	If set, after calculation timing info, a check is always done to see
	if the time has not become a NaN value.

POPULATION_ALWAYS_RECALCULATE: used in src/lib/core/population.cpp

	If set, all event times will always be recalculated, similar to the
	basic mNRM version.
